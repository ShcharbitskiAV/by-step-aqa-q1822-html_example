	A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <b style="color: #ff6600;"><sup><acronym ="">[1]</acronym></sup></b>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, <br> bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses, mobility scooters for disabled people), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, <br> boats, underwater vehicles), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicles, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, aerostats) and <br> spacecraft. <b style="color: #ff6600;"><sup><acronym ="">[2]</acronym></sup></b> <br>
